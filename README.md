Hello.  
Currently I'm interested in electronics / low level computing.  
I'm still a novice in most aspects, lacking in experience, and knowledge, but interested to learn.  
I currently do coding / programming as a hobby, but maybe one day I'll take it further.  
Check out my repos, not everthing is finished or super high quality, but perhaps you can learn, or take inspiration from my work.  
If you would like to contact me, shoot me an email, blinjko@gmail.com  
Constructive criticism is welcome.
